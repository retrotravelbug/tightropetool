<img id="tightrope-toolkit" src="resources/images/tightrope.png" alt="registered logo" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:400px;">

Want to engage young people in open discussions about their circumstances and future goals?

Regardless of a young person’s presenting needs this Adolescent Tightrope [toolkit] offers a holistic approach in social work, youth offending, substance misuse work, mental health or wellbeing support.

Supporting current approaches of trauma informed practice, Signs of Safety®, GoodLives, Desistance Theory and Motivational Interviewing the toolkit is based on an analogy that being a teenager and moving into adulthood can be like walking on a Tightrope and supports an open discussion to reflect on key areas within assessments and plans:

-	Central values – the intentions and motives of past or future behaviour
-	What might falling off look like – the behavior we are worried might happen in the future
-	Future goals and aspirations
-	Protective foundations – times of success and exceptions to harm that keep the foundation under the tightrope stable
-	Muddy Path – experiences in the past that makes things more wobbly now
-	Steps up  – current worries or complicating factors making the risk (ladder) higher
-	Balancing Strengths – individual strengths to help manage the situation
-	Safety Net – those who support and help now
-	Steps Down – actions needed / planning for future goals and safe ground

## Evidence based direct work tool
The [toolkit] is available to download and includes the following:
-	an introduction to the analogy and how it can be applied within risk assessments
-	background to the development, use in practice and testimonials from practitioners and young people during the pilot
- outlines the specialist fields that overlap to support a holistic model for adolescents and provides a summary of the interviewing methods and practice models that are compatible with the tight rope
- templates to record a summary of your assessment and prompt cards that you can print, cut out, then laminate (or print on card) to use in direct work. Each card is listed with references to provide more information about why that factor was chosen.  
- guidance to practitioners about the role of the worker, factors to consider in application (age, culture, and gender) and how to evaluate progress or impact of the tool
- a full list of references are provided

# Extras

A brief [sample workbook] of the tightrope is also available

For Youth Justice practitioners an Out of Court Disposal template has been created and is available here: [OOCD Screening Template 2019.pdf]

## Workbook for parents

The original use of the tightrope analogy was with parents whose children were open to the Youth Justice service. Using research about supporting parents of adolescents, a basic homemade workbook was created called the [Circus Act] that supports parents to work through exercises that are based on the circus:
- balancing act, which uses the tightrope analogy and explores the young person's strengths and how the parent provides a safety net that is not too lose or too tight
- backstage - chronology direct work tool that recognises that the young person and parent may have different perceptions about the same family experiences
- hall of mirrors to understand the parent's own experiences of being parented
- jugglig act to identify the number of tasks and responsibilities the parent is having to juggle and what they could let go
- seal act to understand what stress and pressure the young person is faced with
- lion tamer to support boundaries and rule setting, with negotiation
- knife throwing to support fair and balanced arguments
- Magicians tricks, the magic wand of parenting - having fun and special time with their child
