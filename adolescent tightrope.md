<img id="tightrope-toolkit" src="resources/images/tightrope.png" alt="registered logo" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:400px;">

Want to engage young people in open discussions about their circumstances and future goals?

Regardless of a young person’s presenting needs the Adolescent Tightrope offers a holistic approach in practice

Supporting current approaches of trauma informed practice, Signs of Safety®, GoodLives, Desistance Theory and Motivational Interviewing the toolkit is based on an analogy that being a teenager and moving into adulthood can be like walking on a Tightrope and supports an open discussion to reflect on key areas within assessments and plans:

-	Central values – the intentions and motives of past or future behaviour
-	What might falling off look like – the behavior we are worried might happen in the future
-	Future goals and aspirations
-	Protective foundations – times of success and exceptions to harm that keep the foundation under the tightrope stable
-	Muddy Path – experiences in the past that makes things more wobbly now
-	Balancing Strengths – individual strengths to help manage the situation
-	Steps up  – current worries or complicating factors making the risk (ladder) higher
-	Safety Net – those who support and help now
-	Steps Down – actions needed / planning for future goals and safe ground

## Evidence based direct work tool
The toolkit is drawn from research on adolescent risks (youth offending, self-harm, substance misuse and exploitation) and research on resilience and social capital. The toolkit includes:
-	an introduction to the analogy and how it can be applied to assess risk and resilience
- outlines the changes that occur during adolescence and the impact of trauma on development
- provides templates to record a summary of your assessment with an outline of the various models that support or align with the model
- suggestions for questions to ask and prompt cards that you can print and cut out to use in direct work (the set of cards can be downloaded below)
- each prompt card is supported by references to show why that factor was included  
- guidance to practitioners about the role of the worker, factors to consider in application and how to evaluate progress or impact of the tool
- a full list of references are provided

## [Download Printable cards]

The cards in the guidance workbook can be printed from the workbook or collectively from here so you can print off, cut out and laminate each card, or page of cards. There are also mats that have all the cards from each area together. 

## [Purchase the toolkit with printed cards]
If you or your team want the hardcopy toolkit with 8 sets of printed cards and two pads with the template form to complete then a few sets are still available from the link above.

## Workbook for parents

The original use of the tightrope analogy was with parents whose children were open to the Youth Justice service. Using research about supporting parents of adolescents, a basic homemade workbook was created called the [Circus Act] that supports parents to work through exercises that are based on the circus:
- balancing act, which uses the tightrope analogy and explores the young person's strengths and how the parent provides a safety net that is not too lose or too tight
- backstage - chronology direct work tool that recognises that the young person and parent may have different perceptions about the same family experiences
- hall of mirrors to understand the parent's own experiences of being parented
- jugglig act to identify the number of tasks and responsibilities the parent is having to juggle and what they could let go
- seal act to understand what stress and pressure the young person is faced with
- lion tamer to support boundaries and rule setting, with negotiation
- knife throwing to support fair and balanced arguments
- Magicians tricks, the magic wand of parenting - having fun and special time with their child
