# Wellbeing Tightrope <small>For anyone Balancing on the Tightrope of Life</small>

The tightrope has evolved into a framework for anyone facing a number of pressures and responsibilities. Or perhaps you have a goal or dream that requires a change process and this can create a tightrope situation. The aim is that...
- reflecting on your goals and the factors that support you can increase resilience
- the framework acknowledges past experiences and current pressures that can make achieving your goal more difficult
- you can explore your qualities and strengths and see patterns in the behaviours that are unhelpful
- by utilising Emotional Freedom Technique (also known as 'tapping') you can clear limiting beliefs and create a space for healing

### If you are a parent of an adolescent

The original use of the tightrope analogy was with parents whose children were open to the Youth Justice service. Using research about supporting parents of adolescents, a basic homemade workbook was created called the [Circus Act] that supports parents to work through exercises that are based on the circus:
- balancing act, which uses the tightrope analogy and explores the young person's strengths and how the parent provides a safety net that is not too lose or too tight
- backstage - chronology direct work tool that recognises that the young person and parent may have different perceptions about the same family experiences
- hall of mirrors to understand the parent's own experiences of being parented
- jugglig act to identify the number of tasks and responsibilities the parent is having to juggle and what they could let go
- seal act to understand what stress and pressure the young person is faced with
- lion tamer to support boundaries and rule setting, with negotiation
- knife throwing to support fair and balanced arguments
- Magicians tricks, the magic wand of parenting - having fun and special time with their child
