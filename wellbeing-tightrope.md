# Wellbeing Tightrope <small>Balancing on the Tightrope of Life</small>

This has been designed for individuals facing a number of pressures and responsibilities or wanting to enter into a change process in order to achieve their goals and dreams. The tightrope tool has been developed into a framework and is supported by Emotional Freedom Technique approaches. The aim is that...
- by reflecting on your own tightrope you might discover ways to increase self-resilience
- using the same analogy and features of the tightrope you can explore behaviours that support you to balance or those that are unhelpful
- by utilising Emotional Freedom Technique (also known as 'tapping') you can clear limiting beliefs and create a space for healing

### Workbook for parents of adolescents

The original use of the tightrope analogy was with parents whose children were open to the Youth Justice service. Using research about supporting parents of adolescents, a basic homemade workbook was created called the [Circus Act] that supports parents to work through exercises that are based on the circus:
- balancing act, which uses the tightrope analogy and explores the young person's strengths and how the parent provides a safety net that is not too lose or too tight
- backstage - chronology direct work tool that recognises that the young person and parent may have different perceptions about the same family experiences
- hall of mirrors to understand the parent's own experiences of being parented
- jugglig act to identify the number of tasks and responsibilities the parent is having to juggle and what they could let go
- seal act to understand what stress and pressure the young person is faced with
- lion tamer to support boundaries and rule setting, with negotiation
- knife throwing to support fair and balanced arguments
- Magicians tricks, the magic wand of parenting - having fun and special time with their child
