# About the Tightrope

The Tightrope Tool is the creation of [Dr Roberta Evans][profile], a qualified social worker with aÂ Professional Doctorate in Youth Justice and nearly 20 years experience in practice, ranging from front-line social work in New Zealand and the UK, senior practitioner and manager, to practice development and training. 

The idea of using the analogy of the tightrope in her work was first introduced by her mother, Marjan Lousberg, when discussing how to engage parents whose children were open to the Youth Justice Service. This led to the development of the Circus Act, then following her doctorate, the Tightrope and then, in collaboration with Richard Swan, the Practitioner Tightrope 
All products and materials are developed and delivered by Dr Evans, unless stated otherwise.
