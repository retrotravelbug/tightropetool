# Wellbeing Tightrope <small>For anyone Balancing on the Tightrope of Life</small>

The tightrope has evolved into a framework for anyone facing a number of pressures and responsibilities. Or perhaps you have a goal or dream that requires a change process and this can create a tightrope situation. The aim is that...
- reflecting on your goals and the factors that support you can increase resilience
- the framework acknowledges past experiences and current pressures that can make achieving your goal more difficult
- you can explore your qualities and strengths and see patterns in the behaviours that are unhelpful
- by utilising Emotional Freedom Technique (also known as 'tapping') you can clear limiting beliefs and create a space for healing
